And while its scenario continues and deepens the game's exploration of the mystical realms between the traditional roleplaying and card game experiences, its twenty-four player cards (two copies each of twelve different cards) provide you access to a number of wealthy Patrons and allow you to \"learn\" from your mistakes.  Contains cards 147-188 of The Path to Carcosa cycle. "

While the existing factions are bolstered by new units and abilities, two new empires join the conflict: the Orcs of the Broken Plains and the Dwarves of Dunwarr. At the same time, new scenarios challenge your deck-building prowess and new Mercenary cards provide even more strategic options. Unite the tribes, fire the forges, and experience Rune Age like never before!<br />Rune Age is a deck-building game of adventure and conquest for 2-4 players. <br /><br />Set in the fantasy realm of Terrinoth (Runebound, Descent: Journeys in the Dark, Runewars, and DungeonQuest), Rune Age puts players in control of one of four races, vying for dominance in a world embroiled in conflict.<br /><br />Designed by Corey Konieczka, Rune Age is a unique deck-building game that centers around scenarios.<br />Each of the four included scenarios presents different objectives for players, ranging from competitive to fully cooperative. Will you wage war against each other in search of the legendary dragon runes? Or will you pull your forces together and face the deadliest storm Terrinoth has ever seen? The choice is yours.</p>",

      "description_preview": " Enhance every aspect of Rune Age with the Oath and Anvil expansion! While the existing factions are bolstered by new units and abilities, two new empires join the conflict: the Orcs of the Broken Plains and the Dwarves of Dunwarr. At the same time, new scenarios challenge your deck-building prowess and new Mercenary cards provide even more strategic options. Unite the tribes, fire the forges, and experience Rune Age like never before! Rune Age is a deck-building game of adventure and conquest for 2-4 players.   Set in the fantasy realm of Terrinoth (Runebound, Descent: Journeys in the Dark, Runewars, and DungeonQuest), Rune Age puts players in control of one of four races, vying for dominance in a world embroiled in conflict.  Designed by Corey Konieczka, Rune Age is a unique deck-building game that centers around scenarios. Each of the four included scenarios presents different objectives for players, ranging from competitive to fully cooperative. Will you wage war against each other in search of the legendary dragon runes? Or will you pull your forces together and face the deadliest storm Terrinoth has ever seen? The choice is yours. "
